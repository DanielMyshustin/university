## Desription of Entityes:

# Student

The student extends the User entity and has a bidirectional relationship with the group entity.  A student can exist on his own, outside the group.  From this comes the attitude towards the group, either 0 or 1 (the student may or may not have a group).

# Group 

A group itself consists of a list of students, therefore it relates to one to many students (one group can have one or more students), however, a group without students can also exist, and also partially aggregates the essence of the schedule, in a one-to-one relationship.

# Teacher 

The teacher, like the student, expands the User class.  And it has a bidirectional relationship with the Course entity, both entities cannot exist one without the other, which determines the one-to-one relationship (one teacher has one course).

# Course 

The course is connected with one teacher, and also partially aggregates the essence of the schedule, in a one-to-one relationship.

# Time

The Time entity is a class with a list of time periods, which in turn aggregates the Schedule class, with a one-to-one relationship.

# Schedule

A schedule is an entity compiled and aggregated data from other entities listed above and has a one-to-one relationship with all of them.  It contains all the necessary data to be presented in the form of a full schedule for the user interface.
